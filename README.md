# Future

Define: *Futures* :

"Futures (also known as "promises") are objects which act as placeholders for
some future result of computation. They let you express parallel and
asynchronous execution with a natural syntax. There are three provided
concrete Future implementations: ExecFuture for executing system commands,
HTTPFuture for making HTTP requests, and QueryFuture for executing database
queries." - *Facebook*

This set of files was originaly forked from Facebook's `libphutil` which has
some pretty nifty little tools, you should go check it out!

These libraries are for everything in the `src/future` and have been namespaced
up.
